## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `build`: migrate the build toolchain from pixi/conda to uv (Odysseus ADR-018,
  mirroring Nestor #133 and Agamemnon #457). CMake, Ninja, Conan, gcovr, and
  pre-commit are now uv-managed locked PyPI wheels (`pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`
  + `.python-version`); the C++ compiler, clang-format/clang-tidy, lcov, and the
  OpenSSL dev headers come from the system (apt). gtest continues to be provided
  by Conan (`conanfile.py`). CI swaps `prefix-dev/setup-pixi` for
  `astral-sh/setup-uv` and the `pixi-check` job becomes `uv-check`; every
  required check-run name (`lint`, `unit-tests`, `integration-tests`, `build`,
  `test`, `package`, `install`, `coverage`, `release`, `schema-validation`,
  `deps/version-sync`, `security/*`) is preserved, and the canonical `release`
  gate + `publish-release` naming are untouched (no release-check collision).
  The Containerfile builder pulls uv via a pinned `COPY --from` named stage.

### Added

- Integration test `SchedulerSigtermTest` verifying SIGTERM mid-flight causes graceful drain: all submitted tasks
complete before worker threads exit (#303)
- Migrate dependency management to Conan 2 with CMakePresets ([220326c](../../commit/220326c))
- NATS subject schema documentation and payload envelope contract
- Pre-commit CI job enforcing all hook checks
- Dependency vulnerability scanning in CI
- Pytest-cov coverage reporting in CI
- Mypy type checking in CI pipeline
- `TASK_PHASE_ERROR` variant with centralized terminal state checks
- Structured JSON logging for log aggregation
- `/v1/health` monitoring endpoint with NATS status tracking
- NATS reconnection callbacks and error handling
- `NATSListener` with explicit JetStream ack/nak on every code path
- `TASK_FAILED` event handling to prevent DAG deadlocks
- `test_task_claimer.py` and shared `tests/helpers.py` test utilities
- `justfile` wrapping Makefile for ecosystem convention
- Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ([b9d15bc](../../commit/b9d15bc))
- Rewrite CLAUDE.md for pure transport role, remove HMAS hierarchy ([f442d1a](../../commit/f442d1a))

### Changed

- Remove duplicate clang-format step from lint job; pre-commit hook (mirrors-clang-format v18.1.0) is the single source
of truth for C++ formatting checks
- License file updated to BSD 3-Clause (replacing MIT placeholder)
- Audit remediation: corrected the remaining MIT license references (README badge and license section,
`CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE`, `docs/PACKAGING.md` example) to BSD-3-Clause so advertised licensing matches the
actual `LICENSE` file (#504)
- Audit remediation: `Containerfile` test stage now ships the transport/concurrency smoke tests
(`transport_unit_tests`, `bridge_unit_tests`, `concurrency_unit_tests`) instead of the removed agent
delegation/coordination e2e binaries — the agent hierarchy and Python orchestration were already extracted to
ProjectAgamemnon (ADR-015/016, #578) (#504)
- Unsized integers converted to sized types (`int32_t`, `uint32_t`, `size_t`)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` rewritten to match current C++20/Conan/just workflow
- `pixi.toml` and `justfile` aligned with ecosystem conventions
- Address audit quick wins — security, templates, DX improvements ([6fbb180](../../commit/6fbb180))
- `ci`: Bump github-actions group across 1 directory with 3 updates ([c916699](../../commit/c916699))

### Fixed

- `ci`: gtest test discovery is deferred from build time to test time
  (`DISCOVERY_MODE PRE_TEST` on all `gtest_discover_tests()` calls), so sanitizer
  builds no longer fail at compile time with a CTest `ParseTestList` JSON parse
  error; the `Makefile` gains a `CTEST_EXTRA` passthrough and the sanitizer ctest
  phases in `scripts/run_ci_local.sh` use `--repeat until-pass:2` to tolerate one
  transient flake (#645)
- `monitoring`: Add `.load()` for atomic `server_fd_` and `port_` usages ([4a583ed](../../commit/4a583ed))
- Resolve CI failures — TSan data races, MSan removal, Dockerfile COPY paths ([412b73c](../../commit/412b73c))
- `ci`: Apply clang-format-18 and fix Dockerfile COPY for disabled tests ([14e9e42](../../commit/14e9e42))
- DAG agent availability filtering to check current task assignment
- DAG-walker recursive DFS replaced with iterative cycle detection
- CI: Conan 2 wired into CI, Makefile, and Dockerfile
- CI: security-scan.yml rewritten for C++20/pixi project
- CI: `pull-requests: write` permission for PR summary comments
- TSan data races in `SimulatedNUMANode`; `ConcurrentQueue` false positives suppressed
- `ThreadPoolTest.CreateAndDestroy` disabled under sanitizer builds
- `spdlog` and `concurrentqueue` promoted to `PUBLIC` in CMake targets
- Atomic `server_fd_` and `port_` accesses use `.load()`
