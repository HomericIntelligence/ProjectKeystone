# Keystone HMAS - C++20 Build Environment

# Pulled as a named stage so `COPY --from=uv` resolves identically under both
# podman/buildah and docker. A bare `COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:<tag>@<digest>`
# (tag AND digest together) is rejected by buildah with "no stage or image found
# with that name", so we alias the digest-pinned image to a stage name here and
# COPY from the alias. Keep this pin in sync with astral-sh/setup-uv in
# .github/workflows/*.yml when bumping (Odysseus ADR-018).

#
# The venv MUST live OUTSIDE /workspace: the `dev`/`build` compose services
# bind-mount the host repo over `.:/workspace:Z` at run time, which masks any
# `/workspace/.venv` baked into the image — so a default in-tree venv vanishes
# the moment the container starts. Installing it at /opt/venv keeps the locked
# build toolchain (conan/cmake/ninja/gcovr) present at run time regardless of
# the bind mount.
#
# Putting /opt/venv/bin on PATH makes the tools resolvable by their BARE names
# (`conan`, `cmake`, `ninja`, `gcovr`) — which is exactly how the Makefile's
# container recipes invoke them (`$(CONTAINER_PREFIX) conan ...`, Makefile:83).
# Before ADR-018 these came from apt (`cmake`) and a system pip `conan`, so
# they were on PATH; uv-managing them without this PATH entry is what broke
# `make deps` in the lint/coverage jobs with "conan: executable file not found"
# (exit 127). UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR keeps uv's downloaded CPython out of
# /root/.local (mode 0700) so the non-root compose `user:` can reach it.
