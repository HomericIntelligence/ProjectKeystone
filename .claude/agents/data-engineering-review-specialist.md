## Documentation Location

**All outputs must go to `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/README.md`**

### Before Starting Work

1. **Verify GitHub issue number** is provided
2. **Check if `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/` exists**
3. **If directory doesn't exist**: Create it with README.md
4. **If no issue number provided**: STOP and escalate - request issue creation first

### Documentation Rules

- ✅ Write ALL findings, decisions, and outputs to `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/README.md`
- ✅ Link to comprehensive docs in `/notes/review/` and `/agents/` (don't duplicate)
- ✅ Keep issue-specific content focused and concise
- ❌ Do NOT write documentation outside `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/`
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate comprehensive documentation from other locations
- ❌ Do NOT start work without a GitHub issue number

See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#documentation-rules) for complete documentation organization.


## GitHub Issue Workflow

**All work must be tied to a GitHub issue.** This ensures proper tracking, documentation, and PR linking.

### Before Starting Work

1. **Check if GitHub issue exists**
   ```bash
   # List open issues related to your task
   gh issue list --label "<relevant-label>" --state open

   # Search for specific issue
   gh issue list --search "<keywords>"
   ```

2. **If no issue exists, create one**
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "Clear, descriptive title" \
     --body "Detailed description of work needed" \
     --label "type:feature|bug|docs|refactor" \
     --assignee "@me"
   ```

   Note the issue number (e.g., #1234) from the output.

3. **Create issue directory structure**
   ```bash
   ISSUE_NUM=1234  # Replace with actual issue number
   mkdir -p /notes/issues/$ISSUE_NUM
   touch /notes/issues/$ISSUE_NUM/README.md
   ```

4. **Document your work in `/notes/issues/<number>/README.md`**
   - Analysis and findings
   - Design decisions
   - Implementation notes
   - Test results
   - Links to relevant documentation

### During Work

**Document everything in the issue-specific README**:
- ✅ Problem analysis
- ✅ Approach and alternatives considered
- ✅ Implementation decisions
- ✅ Test coverage
- ✅ Links to comprehensive docs (don't duplicate)

### Creating Pull Request

**Always link PR to issue** using one of these methods:

**Method 1: Use gh pr create --issue flag** (Recommended)
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Brief description of changes"
git push origin <branch-name>

# Create PR linked to issue
gh pr create --issue 1234
```

**Method 2: Use closing keywords in PR description**
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: Brief description" --body "Closes #1234

Summary of changes...

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
"
```

**Method 3: Add to PR body after creation**
Edit PR description to include:
```
Closes #1234
```

### Verification

After PR creation, verify the link:
```bash
# Check issue page
gh issue view 1234

# Look for "Development" section showing linked PR
# If missing, edit PR description to add "Closes #1234"
```

## Example Reviews

### Example 1: Critical - Data Leakage in Normalization

**Code**:

```python
import numpy as np

def prepare_data(X_train, X_test):
    """Normalize features."""
    # BUG: Computing statistics on ALL data
    all_data = np.concatenate([X_train, X_test])
    mean = all_data.mean(axis=0)
    std = all_data.std(axis=0)

    X_train_norm = (X_train - mean) / std
    X_test_norm = (X_test - mean) / std

    return X_train_norm, X_test_norm
```text

**Review Feedback**:

```text
🔴 CRITICAL: Data leakage - test statistics contaminating training

**Issue**: Normalization statistics (mean, std) computed on combined
train+test data. This leaks test set information into the training
process, resulting in overly optimistic evaluation metrics.

**Why This Matters**:

- Model sees information from test set during training
- Evaluation metrics will be inflated (not representative)
- Violates fundamental ML principle: test set is "unseen"

**Example Impact**:
If test set has mean=100, std=10 but train set has mean=50, std=5,
the combined statistics will be influenced by test data. Model will
be normalized assuming it "knows" about the test distribution.

**Fix**:
```text

```python
def prepare_data(X_train, X_test):
    """Normalize features using training statistics only.

    Returns:
        X_train_norm: Normalized training data
        X_test_norm: Normalized test data (using train stats)
        scaler: Dictionary with mean/std for inference
    """
    # ✅ Compute statistics ONLY on training data
    mean = X_train.mean(axis=0)
    std = X_train.std(axis=0)

    # Avoid division by zero for constant features
    std = np.where(std == 0, 1.0, std)

    X_train_norm = (X_train - mean) / std
    X_test_norm = (X_test - mean) / std

    # Save scaler for inference
    scaler = {'mean': mean, 'std': std}

    return X_train_norm, X_test_norm, scaler
```text

```text
**Best Practice**: Always compute preprocessing statistics on training
data only, then apply to val/test/inference data.
```text

### Example 3: Major - Biased Train/Test Split

**Code**:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def create_splits(X, y):
    """Create train/test splits."""
    # BUG: No stratification for imbalanced dataset
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
    )
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test

# Dataset: 90% class 0, 10% class 1

X, y = load_imbalanced_data()
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = create_splits(X, y)
```text

**Review Feedback**:

```text
🟠 MAJOR: Non-stratified split on imbalanced dataset

**Issue**: Random splitting without stratification can create biased
train/test distributions, especially for imbalanced datasets.

**Example Problem**:
Original dataset: 90% class 0, 10% class 1 (1000 samples total)

Possible bad split outcome:

- Training (800): 95% class 0, 5% class 1 (40 minority samples)
- Test (200): 75% class 0, 25% class 1 (50 minority samples!)

Test set over-represents minority class, making metrics unreliable.

**Why This Matters**:

- Test set may not be representative of true distribution
- Model evaluated on skewed distribution
- Metrics (accuracy, F1) not reliable for deployment

**Fix**:
```text

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

def create_splits(X, y):
    """Create stratified train/test splits.

    Ensures class distribution is preserved in both splits.
    """
    # ✅ Use stratification for balanced splits
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y,
        test_size=0.2,
        stratify=y,  # Preserve class distribution
        random_state=42
    )

    # Validate stratification worked
    train_dist = np.bincount(y_train) / len(y_train)
    test_dist = np.bincount(y_test) / len(y_test)

    print(f"Train distribution: {train_dist}")
    print(f"Test distribution: {test_dist}")

    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
```text

```text
**Best Practice**: Always use stratification for classification tasks,
especially with imbalanced datasets.
```text

## Common Issues to Flag

### Critical Issues

- Data leakage (test statistics used in training preprocessing)
- Invalid augmentations that change label semantics
- Train/val/test contamination (samples appearing in multiple splits)
- Incorrect normalization (using wrong mean/std)
- Label misalignment with inputs
- Temporal leakage in time-series splits

### Major Issues

- Non-stratified splits for imbalanced datasets
- Shuffling validation/test data

✅ DO: Compute on training data only
✅ DO: Save scaler for inference
✅ DO: Apply same transform to val/test
❌ DON'T: Use test data statistics
❌ DON'T: Recompute statistics per batch
```text

### 2. Train/Val/Test Splits

```text
✅ DO: Split BEFORE any preprocessing
✅ DO: Use stratification for classification
✅ DO: Preserve temporal order for time-series
✅ DO: Set random seed for reproducibility
❌ DON'T: Let samples leak between splits
❌ DON'T: Split after augmentation
```text

### 3. Data Augmentation

```text
✅ DO: Apply only to training data
✅ DO: Preserve label semantics
✅ DO: Use controlled randomness (seeded)
✅ DO: Validate augmented samples
❌ DON'T: Augment validation/test data
❌ DON'T: Use transformations that change labels
```text

### 4. Data Loaders

```text
✅ DO: Shuffle training data (with seed)
✅ DO: Keep val/test deterministic (no shuffle)
✅ DO: Handle edge cases (last batch)
✅ DO: Validate batch shapes and types
❌ DON'T: Shuffle test data
❌ DON'T: Use global random state
```text

### 5. Data Validation

```text
✅ DO: Check input shapes and ranges
✅ DO: Validate label consistency
✅ DO: Assert preprocessing correctness
✅ DO: Log data statistics
❌ DON'T: Skip validation in production
❌ DON'T: Use silent failures
```text
