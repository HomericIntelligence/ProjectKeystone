## Documentation Location

**All outputs must go to `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/README.md`**

### Before Starting Work

1. **Verify GitHub issue number** is provided
2. **Check if `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/` exists**
3. **If directory doesn't exist**: Create it with README.md
4. **If no issue number provided**: STOP and escalate - request issue creation first

### Documentation Rules

- ✅ Write ALL findings, decisions, and outputs to `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/README.md`
- ✅ Link to comprehensive docs in `/notes/review/` and `/agents/` (don't duplicate)
- ✅ Keep issue-specific content focused and concise
- ❌ Do NOT write documentation outside `/notes/issues/`issue-number`/`
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate comprehensive documentation from other locations
- ❌ Do NOT start work without a GitHub issue number

See [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md#documentation-rules) for complete documentation organization.


## GitHub Issue Workflow

**All work must be tied to a GitHub issue.** This ensures proper tracking, documentation, and PR linking.

### Before Starting Work

1. **Check if GitHub issue exists**
   ```bash
   # List open issues related to your task
   gh issue list --label "<relevant-label>" --state open

   # Search for specific issue
   gh issue list --search "<keywords>"
   ```

2. **If no issue exists, create one**
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "Clear, descriptive title" \
     --body "Detailed description of work needed" \
     --label "type:feature|bug|docs|refactor" \
     --assignee "@me"
   ```

   Note the issue number (e.g., #1234) from the output.

3. **Create issue directory structure**
   ```bash
   ISSUE_NUM=1234  # Replace with actual issue number
   mkdir -p /notes/issues/$ISSUE_NUM
   touch /notes/issues/$ISSUE_NUM/README.md
   ```

4. **Document your work in `/notes/issues/<number>/README.md`**
   - Analysis and findings
   - Design decisions
   - Implementation notes
   - Test results
   - Links to relevant documentation

### During Work

**Document everything in the issue-specific README**:
- ✅ Problem analysis
- ✅ Approach and alternatives considered
- ✅ Implementation decisions
- ✅ Test coverage
- ✅ Links to comprehensive docs (don't duplicate)

### Creating Pull Request

**Always link PR to issue** using one of these methods:

**Method 1: Use gh pr create --issue flag** (Recommended)
```bash
# Commit and push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Brief description of changes"
git push origin <branch-name>

# Create PR linked to issue
gh pr create --issue 1234
```

**Method 2: Use closing keywords in PR description**
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: Brief description" --body "Closes #1234

Summary of changes...

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
"
```

**Method 3: Add to PR body after creation**
Edit PR description to include:
```
Closes #1234
```

### Verification

After PR creation, verify the link:
```bash
# Check issue page
gh issue view 1234

# Look for "Development" section showing linked PR
# If missing, edit PR description to add "Closes #1234"
```

## Example Reviews

### Example 1: Incorrect Ownership - Unnecessary Copy

**Code**:

```mojo
fn process_tensor(owned tensor: Tensor) -> Float32:
    """Compute sum of tensor elements."""
    var total: Float32 = 0.0
    for i in range(tensor.size()):
        total += tensor[i]
    return total
```text

**Review Feedback**:

```text
🔴 CRITICAL: Incorrect ownership pattern - unnecessary copy

**Issue**: Function takes `owned` parameter but only reads the tensor.
This forces the caller to give up ownership or make an explicit copy,
which is expensive for large tensors.

**Impact**:

- Unnecessary memory allocation and copy for every call
- Breaks caller's ability to use tensor after call
- Performance penalty scales with tensor size

**Fix**: Use `borrowed` for read-only access:
```text

```mojo
fn process_tensor(borrowed tensor: Tensor) -> Float32:
    """Compute sum of tensor elements."""
    var total: Float32 = 0.0
    for i in range(tensor.size()):
        total += tensor[i]
    return total
```text

```text
**Benefits**:

- ✅ No copy required
- ✅ Caller retains ownership
- ✅ Zero performance overhead
- ✅ Clearer intent (read-only access)

**Rule**: Use `borrowed` for read-only access, `owned` only when
taking ownership is necessary (e.g., storing in a struct, consuming).
```text

### Example 3: fn vs def Misuse

**Code**:

```mojo
def matrix_multiply(a: Tensor, b: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """Multiply two matrices - performance critical operation."""
    # ... complex implementation ...
    return result
```text

**Review Feedback**:

```text
🟠 MAJOR: Using 'def' for performance-critical code

**Issue**: Matrix multiplication is a performance-critical operation
but uses `def` instead of `fn`. This prevents compile-time
optimizations and type checking.

**Implications of 'def'**:

- ❌ Dynamic typing overhead
- ❌ No compile-time type verification
- ❌ Missed optimization opportunities
- ❌ Runtime type checking cost
- ✅ Flexible for prototyping (not needed here)

**Recommendation**: Use `fn` for performance-critical code:
```text

```mojo
fn matrix_multiply(borrowed a: Tensor, borrowed b: Tensor) -> Tensor:
    """Multiply two matrices - performance critical operation.

    Args:
        a: Left matrix (M x K)
        b: Right matrix (K x N)

    Returns:
        Result matrix (M x N)

    Raises:
        Error if dimensions don't match (a.cols != b.rows)
    """
    if a.cols != b.rows:
        raise Error("Incompatible dimensions")

    # ... implementation with compile-time optimizations ...
    return result
```text

```text
**Benefits**:

- ✅ Compile-time type checking
- ✅ Better optimization opportunities
- ✅ Explicit ownership (borrowed - no copies)
- ✅ Documented error conditions (raises)
- ✅ Faster execution

**Rule of Thumb**:

- Use `fn`: Production code, performance-critical, APIs
- Use `def`: Prototyping, Python interop, exploratory code

```text

## Common Issues to Flag

### Critical Issues

- Incorrect ownership causing memory leaks or double-frees
- Missing lifecycle methods for types managing resources
- SIMD operations with incorrect logic or alignment
- Dangling borrowed references
- fn vs def misuse in production code
- Parameter usage in runtime-only contexts

### Major Issues

- Unnecessary owned parameters forcing copies
- Missed SIMD vectorization opportunities
- Incorrect inout usage (should be borrowed)
- Missing @parameter for compile-time constants
- Inefficient move operations
- Trait implementation errors

### Minor Issues

- Inconsistent ownership patterns
- Suboptimal SIMD width choices
- Overly conservative borrowed usage
- Unnecessary type constraints
- Style guide violations
- Missing move constructors (performance, not correctness)

## Mojo Best Practices Reference

### Ownership Rules

**Use `owned`**:

- Taking ownership of a value
- Storing in a struct field
- Consuming the parameter
- Transferring ownership

**Use `borrowed`**:

- Read-only access (most common)
- Temporary inspection
- No ownership transfer
- Zero-copy access

**Use `inout`**:

- Mutating the parameter
- In-place modifications
- Caller expects changes
- Exclusive mutable access

### fn vs def Guidelines

**Use `fn`**:

- Production code
- Performance-critical paths
- Public APIs
- When type safety is critical
- When optimization matters

**Use `def`**:

- Prototyping and exploration
- Python interoperability
- Flexible/dynamic behavior
- Testing and debugging
- One-off scripts

### SIMD Best Practices

**When to use SIMD**:

- Element-wise array operations
- Data-parallel computations
- Contiguous memory access
- Performance-critical loops

**SIMD considerations**:

- Handle remainder elements
- Ensure proper alignment
- Use hardware-specific widths
- Benchmark actual speedup
- Document SIMD assumptions

### Compile-Time Features

**Use `@parameter`**:

- Compile-time constants
- Loop unrolling hints
- Generic type parameters
- Configuration values

**Parameter guidelines**:

- Keep parameter count reasonable
- Document parameter constraints
- Use meaningful parameter names
- Consider compile-time cost

### Value Type Design

**Lifecycle methods**:

- `__init__`: Always required
- `__copyinit__`: For deep copy semantics
- `__moveinit__`: For efficient moves
- `__del__`: For resource cleanup

**When to implement**:

- Always: `__init__`
- Heap memory: All four methods
- Trivial types: Only `__init__`
- Reference wrapper: Custom copy/move
