## Available Scripts

### `create_phase_issues.sh`

Creates GitHub issues for future implementation phases (7, 8, and 10) based on the plan documents in `docs/plan/`.

**Usage**:

```bash
# Dry run (preview what will be created)
./scripts/create_phase_issues.sh --dry-run

# Actually create issues
./scripts/create_phase_issues.sh
```

**Requirements**:

- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Must be run from project root directory
- Write access to the repository

**What it does**:

1. Reads plan documents (`PHASE_7_PLAN.md`, `PHASE_8_PLAN.md`, `PHASE_10_PLAN.md`)
2. Generates issue bodies with:
   - Overview and links to plan documents
   - Implementation phase checklist
   - Success criteria references
3. Creates GitHub issues with appropriate labels:
   - Phase 7: `phase-7`, `epic`, `enhancement`, `ai`
   - Phase 8: `phase-8`, `epic`, `enhancement`, `distributed`
   - Phase 10: `phase-10`, `epic`, `enhancement`, `observability`

**Example output**:

```
=== ProjectKeystone Phase Issues Creator ===

Creating Phase 7 issues...
✓ Created: https://github.com/user/ProjectKeystone/issues/123

Creating Phase 8 issues...
✓ Created: https://github.com/user/ProjectKeystone/issues/124

Creating Phase 10 issues...
✓ Created: https://github.com/user/ProjectKeystone/issues/125

=== Done! ===
```

**Dry run mode**:

```bash
./scripts/create_phase_issues.sh --dry-run
```

This will show what would be created without actually creating any issues.
