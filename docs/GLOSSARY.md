# ProjectKeystone HMAS - Glossary

**Comprehensive reference of terms, concepts, and acronyms used throughout ProjectKeystone**

---

## Core Architecture Terms

### HMAS
**Hierarchical Multi-Agent System** - A distributed computing architecture where agents are organized in multiple hierarchical layers, communicating via message passing. ProjectKeystone implements a 4-layer HMAS with strategic coordination at the top (Level 0) down to task execution at the bottom (Level 3).

### KIM
**Keystone Interchange Message** - The standard message format for inter-agent communication in ProjectKeystone. Each KIM contains:
- `msg_id`: Unique message identifier
- `sender_id`: ID of the sending agent
- `receiver_id`: ID of the receiving agent
- `command`: The action to perform
- `payload`: Optional JSON data attached to the message
- `timestamp`: When the message was created

See [docs/NETWORK_PROTOCOL.md](./NETWORK_PROTOCOL.md) for complete KIM specification.

### MessageBus
**Central Message Routing Hub** - A decoupled communication infrastructure that handles routing KIM messages between agents without direct agent-to-agent dependencies. The MessageBus:
- Registers and discovers agents dynamically
- Routes messages to their intended recipients
- Enables agent decoupling (agents communicate through IDs, not pointers)
- Maintains thread-safe agent registry with mutex protection
- Supports both synchronous (Phase 1) and asynchronous (Phase 2+) delivery

See [docs/plan/adr/ADR-001-message-bus-architecture.md](./plan/adr/ADR-001-message-bus-architecture.md) for architecture decisions.

## Agent Hierarchy Levels

### L0 (Level 0)
**Strategic Orchestration Layer** - The top level of the HMAS hierarchy, containing the ChiefArchitectAgent. L0 is responsible for:
- Strategic system-wide decisions
- Component selection and coordination
- Overall goal decomposition
- High-level task scheduling

Analogy: CEO/CTO of the system

### L1 (Level 1)
**Component Coordination Layer** - Coordinates multiple modules within a component. Implemented by ComponentLeadAgent. Responsibilities:
- Module coordination and sequencing
- Component-level resource management
- Cross-module dependency resolution
- Result aggregation from modules

Analogy: VP of Engineering for a component

### L2 (Level 2)
**Module Coordination Layer** - Decomposes module-level goals into concrete tasks. Implemented by ModuleLeadAgent. Responsibilities:
- Task decomposition and planning
- Task scheduling and monitoring
- Result synthesis from task agents
- Module-level error handling

Analogy: Tech Lead managing a module

### L3 (Level 3)
**Task Execution Layer** - The lowest level where concrete work happens. Implemented by TaskAgent. Responsibilities:
- Execute individual tasks
- Command execution (bash, system calls, etc.)
- Result reporting back to ModuleLeads
- Task-level error handling

Analogy: Individual Contributor implementing features

## Agent Types

### ChiefArchitect (L0)
**Strategic Orchestrator Agent** - The Level 0 agent that orchestrates the entire HMAS system. It:
- Receives high-level goals or commands
- Decomposes goals into components
- Delegates to ComponentLeadAgents (Phase 3+) or ModuleLeadAgents (Phase 2)
- Aggregates results from lower levels
- Makes strategic architectural decisions

### ComponentLead (L1)
**Component Coordinator Agent** - The Level 1 agent that coordinates multiple modules within a single component. It:
- Receives module planning requests from ChiefArchitect
- Decomposes component goals into module tasks
- Coordinates 2+ ModuleLeadAgents
- Monitors module progress
- Aggregates module results for the ChiefArchitect

Introduced in: Phase 3 (Full 4-Layer Hierarchy)

### ModuleLead (L2)
**Module Coordinator Agent** - The Level 2 agent that breaks down module goals into executable tasks. It:
- Receives task planning goals
- Decomposes goals into concrete executable tasks
- Coordinates 2+ TaskAgents
- Monitors task progress and results
- Synthesizes task results into module output
- Manages state transitions (IDLE → PLANNING → WAITING → SYNTHESIZING)

Introduced in: Phase 2 (3-Layer Hierarchy)

### TaskAgent (L3)
**Task Executor Agent** - The Level 3 agent that executes concrete work. It:
- Receives executable commands
- Executes commands (bash, system operations, etc.)
- Reports results back to ModuleLeads
- Handles task-level errors
- Manages task state (IDLE → EXECUTING → COMPLETED)

Introduced in: Phase 1 (2-Layer Hierarchy)

## Concurrency and Performance Terms

### Work-Stealing Scheduler
**Lock-Free Task Distribution System** - A high-performance task scheduling mechanism that distributes work across worker threads without using locks or mutex primitives. Key characteristics:
- Each worker thread has a local work queue
- When a thread runs out of work, it "steals" tasks from other threads' queues
- Uses atomic operations for lock-free synchronization
- Scales well with many threads
- Minimizes contention and context switching
- Used in Phase 7+ for distributed task execution

### ThreadPool
**Fixed-Size Thread Executor** - A pool of worker threads that execute tasks concurrently. ProjectKeystone uses ThreadPool for:
- Parallel agent execution
- Concurrent message processing
- Load distribution across cores
- Resource-controlled parallelism

### Coroutine
**C++20 Asynchronous Function** - A function that can be suspended and resumed using C++20 coroutine primitives (`co_await`, `co_return`). ProjectKeystone uses coroutines for:
- Non-blocking message processing
- Asynchronous task coordination
- Efficient async/await semantics

### Task<T>
**Custom Awaitable Type** - A C++20 awaitable type that wraps coroutine execution. Features:
- Implements `operator co_await()` for use with `co_await`
- Returns type `T` when completed
- Supports exception propagation
- Used extensively in async message processing

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### TDD
**Test-Driven Development** - A software development methodology where tests are written BEFORE implementation:
1. **RED**: Write failing E2E test
2. **GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass test
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code while keeping tests green
4. **COMMIT**: Submit changes when tests pass

ProjectKeystone strictly follows TDD throughout all phases.

### E2E Tests
**End-to-End Integration Tests** - Comprehensive tests that verify system behavior across multiple layers. ProjectKeystone E2E tests:
- Test full message flows from L0 down to L3
- Verify agent coordination and delegation
- Use Google Test (GTest) framework
- Use descriptive test names (e.g., `TEST(E2E_Phase1, BasicDelegation)`)
- Drive development priorities (TDD approach)

Examples:
- Phase 1: ChiefArchitect → TaskAgent delegation
- Phase 2: ModuleLead coordinates multiple TaskAgents
- Phase 3: ComponentLead coordinates multiple ModuleLeads
- Phase 8: Distributed gRPC communication

### Unit Tests
**Isolated Component Tests** - Tests for individual components in isolation:
- MessageBus routing and discovery
- MessageQueue operations
- ThreadPool task execution
- Coroutine helpers
- Message serialization/deserialization

### Chaos Engineering
**Fault Injection Testing Methodology** - Deliberately introducing failures to test system resilience:
- Random message delays
- Agent process crashes
- Network partition simulation
- Resource exhaustion scenarios
- Used in Phase 5+ for robustness validation

Typical chaos tests:
- 20 random agent failures tolerated
- Message delivery guaranteed despite chaos
- System recovers within reasonable bounds

## Documentation and Decision Making

### ADR
**Architecture Decision Record** - A document that captures an important architectural decision, including:
- **Context**: The issue or problem being addressed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Status**: PROPOSED, ACCEPTED, SUPERSEDED, etc.

ProjectKeystone ADRs are stored in `docs/plan/adr/` with naming convention `ADR-###-title.md`

Examples:
- [ADR-001](./plan/adr/ADR-001-message-bus-architecture.md) - Message Bus Architecture
- [ADR-002](./plan/adr/ADR-002-coroutine-task-design.md) - Coroutine Task Design
- [ADR-003](./plan/adr/ADR-003-work-stealing-scheduler.md) - Work-Stealing Scheduler

### Phase
**Development Iteration** - ProjectKeystone is built through phases following TDD principles:
- **Phase 1** (Weeks 1-3): L0 ↔ L3 basic delegation (2 agents)
- **Phase 2** (Weeks 4-6): L0 ↔ L2 ↔ L3 module coordination (3 layers)
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 7-9): L0 ↔ L1 ↔ L2 ↔ L3 full hierarchy (4 layers)
- **Phase 4-5**: Multi-component and scale testing
- **Phase 6-7**: Performance and distributed features
- **Phase 8** (Optional): gRPC-based distributed multi-node communication

Each phase adds new agent levels or features while maintaining all previous functionality.

## Message Patterns and Communication

### Message Bus Pattern
The pattern where a central bus routes messages between decoupled agents:
- Agents don't need to know physical addresses of other agents
- Dynamic agent registration and discovery
- Synchronous routing in Phase 1, async in Phase 2+

### Delegation Pattern
The pattern where higher-level agents break down goals and delegate work to lower levels:
- ChiefArchitect delegates to ComponentLead (L1)
- ComponentLead delegates to ModuleLead (L2)
- ModuleLead delegates to TaskAgent (L3)

### Result Synthesis Pattern
The pattern where a parent agent aggregates results from child agents:
- ModuleLead waits for all TaskAgent results
- ComponentLead waits for all ModuleLead results
- ChiefArchitect waits for all ComponentLead results

**Single Instruction, Multiple Data** - Vector operations used in performance-critical sections (when applicable to agent operations).

### Lock-Free
**Synchronization without Mutex** - Used in:
- Work-stealing scheduler queues
- Message queue implementation
- Atomic counters for result tracking

### Zero-Copy
**Data Passing without Duplication** - Achieved through:
- Move semantics (C++20)
- Message serialization with minimal overhead
- Shared ownership via `std::shared_ptr` when necessary

---

## State Management

### State Machine
ProjectKeystone agents use finite state machines for coordinated workflows:

**ModuleLeadAgent States**:
- `IDLE`: Waiting for commands
- `PLANNING`: Decomposing goals into tasks
- `WAITING`: Monitoring task execution
- `SYNTHESIZING`: Aggregating task results
- Return to `IDLE`

**ComponentLeadAgent States**:
- `IDLE`: Waiting for commands
- `PLANNING`: Decomposing component goals into modules
