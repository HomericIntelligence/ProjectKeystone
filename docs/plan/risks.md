## Technical Risks

### RISK-T1: C++20 Module Toolchain Maturity

**Category**: Technical - Build System
**Probability**: High
**Impact**: High
**Risk Level**: **CRITICAL**

**Description**:
C++20 modules are relatively new (2020 standard), and compiler/toolchain support varies. Build issues, module dependency errors, and platform-specific incompatibilities could significantly delay development.

**Impact**:
- Build system failures blocking development
- Platform-specific compilation errors
- Increased complexity in CI/CD
- Potential 2-4 week delay in Phase 0-1

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Early Validation** (Week 1):
   - Test module builds on all target platforms immediately
   - Verify compiler versions meet requirements
   - Create proof-of-concept module builds

2. **Fallback Plan**:
   - Maintain traditional header-based implementation in parallel initially
   - Use `#ifdef MODULE_SUPPORT` to toggle between modules and headers
   - Gradual migration: critical paths first, then full conversion

3. **Toolchain Standardization**:
   - Document exact compiler versions that work
   - Lock CI/CD to specific toolchain versions
   - Provide Docker images with validated toolchains

**Contingency Plan**:
If module support proves too unstable by end of Week 2:
- Switch to header-only implementation
- Revisit modules in 6 months when toolchains mature
- Accept longer build times as trade-off

**Monitoring**:
- Weekly build time tracking
- Platform-specific build success rates
- Developer feedback on module errors

### RISK-T2: C++20 Coroutine Performance Overhead

**Category**: Technical - Performance
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Risk Level**: **HIGH**

**Description**:
C++20 coroutines introduce overhead for context switching, suspend/resume operations, and memory allocation. If overhead is too high, the system may not meet the 1M messages/sec throughput target.

**Impact**:
- Missed performance targets
- Increased CPU utilization
- Reduced scalability
- Potential architectural rework

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Early Benchmarking** (Week 4):
   - Create coroutine microbenchmarks immediately after implementation
   - Compare against traditional callback-based async
   - Measure suspend/resume overhead in isolation

2. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Use custom allocators for coroutine frames
   - Implement symmetric transfer for zero-overhead context switching
   - Pool coroutine frames to reduce allocation overhead
   - Profile and optimize hot paths

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Use coroutines for high-level orchestration (Root/Branch agents)
   - Use lock-free queues and callbacks for critical paths (message bus)
   - Balance developer ergonomics with performance

**Contingency Plan**:
If coroutine overhead >10% of total CPU:
- Limit coroutine use to orchestration layer only
- Implement custom lightweight task abstraction
- Consider partial rollback to callback-based async

**Success Metrics**:
- Coroutine suspend/resume <100ns
- No observable performance degradation vs. callbacks
- Throughput target met in benchmarks

   - Test with realistic message sizes

2. **Architectural Mitigations**:
   - Implement per-agent dedicated mailboxes (reduces contention)
   - Use message batching for high-volume scenarios
   - Add backpressure signaling before queue saturation

3. **Alternative Libraries**:
   - Evaluate alternatives (Boost.Lockfree, Folly MPMCQueue)
   - Keep interface abstracted for easy swapping
   - Benchmark comparisons

**Contingency Plan**:
If contention issues arise:
- Switch to alternative queue implementation
- Implement message batching
- Add intermediate message distribution layer
