# ADR-002: Work-Stealing Scheduler Architecture

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Deciders**: ProjectKeystone Development Team
**Tags**: architecture, concurrency, scheduler, phase-c

## Context

ProjectKeystone requires a high-performance scheduler to manage concurrent agent execution across multiple worker threads. Early phases used basic thread pools, but scaling to 100+ agents with coroutine-based execution demanded a more sophisticated approach.

### Requirements

1. **Efficient Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across workers
2. **Cache Locality**: Minimize cache misses and thread migration
3. **Low Latency**: Quick task pickup for responsive agent behavior
4. **Scalability**: Support hundreds of concurrent agents
5. **Coroutine Support**: Seamlessly integrate with C++20 coroutines

### Problems with Basic Thread Pool

1. **Global Queue Contention**: All workers compete for single queue lock
2. **Poor Cache Locality**: Work items accessed by random threads
3. **Load Imbalance**: Some workers idle while others overloaded
4. **No Affinity**: Tasks have no relationship to worker threads

## Decision

Implement **Work-Stealing Scheduler** with per-worker queues and cache-optimized access patterns.

### Design Choices

#### 1. Per-Worker Queues

```cpp
class WorkStealingScheduler {
private:
  std::vector<std::unique_ptr<WorkStealingQueue>> worker_queues_;
  std::vector<std::thread> workers_;
};
```

**Rationale**:
- **No Contention**: Each worker has dedicated queue (lock-free)
- **Cache Locality**: Worker's own tasks stay in local cache
- **Scalability**: Contention-free scaling to 256+ workers

#### 2. LIFO Owner, FIFO Steal Strategy

```cpp
class WorkStealingQueue {
public:
  std::optional<WorkItem> pop();   // LIFO: Owner pops most recent
  std::optional<WorkItem> steal(); // FIFO: Thief steals oldest
};
```

**LIFO Owner Rationale**:
- **Cache Locality**: Most recently pushed items likely still in L1/L2 cache
- **Temporal Locality**: Related tasks submitted close in time
- **Stack-like Behavior**: Natural for recursive/decomposed agent tasks

**FIFO Steal Rationale**:
- **Load Balancing**: Steal oldest work (least likely to be in owner's cache)
- **Fairness**: Prevents starvation of old tasks during stealing
- **Minimal Cache Pollution**: Owner's hot cache not disturbed

#### 3. CPU Affinity (Optional, Phase D)

```cpp
void WorkStealingScheduler::setCPUAffinity(size_t worker_index) {
#ifdef __linux__
  cpu_set_t cpuset;
  CPU_ZERO(&cpuset);
  size_t cpu_id = worker_index % std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
  CPU_SET(cpu_id, &cpuset);
  pthread_setaffinity_np(pthread_self(), sizeof(cpu_set_t), &cpuset);
#endif
}
```

**Rationale**:
- **Cache Affinity**: Worker stays on same CPU core → hot cache
- **Reduced Migration**: OS scheduler cannot move thread across cores
- **NUMA Awareness**: Worker accesses local memory on NUMA systems
- **Optional**: Can disable for shared infrastructure or VMs

**Tradeoff**: Less OS flexibility for load balancing, but better for dedicated agent servers.

#### 4. Adaptive Exponential Backoff

```cpp
// Start with 1μs, double each iteration up to 1ms
size_t backoff_shift = std::min(idle_count, Config::SCHEDULER_MAX_BACKOFF_SHIFT);
size_t sleep_us = std::min(1UL << backoff_shift,
                           Config::SCHEDULER_MAX_BACKOFF_MICROSECONDS);
std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(sleep_us));
```

**Rationale**:
- **Low Initial Latency**: 1μs → fast response to new work
- **Reduced CPU Waste**: Backs off to 1ms under sustained idle
- **Automatic Adaptation**: No manual tuning per deployment
- **Better than Fixed**: Fixed 100μs wastes CPU under load, high latency when idle

#### 5. Round-Robin Submission

```cpp
size_t WorkStealingScheduler::getNextWorkerIndex() {
  size_t idx = next_worker_index_.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
  return idx % num_workers_;
}
```

**Rationale**:
- **Initial Load Balance**: Distributes work evenly across workers
- **Simple**: No complex heuristics needed
- **Stealing Handles Imbalance**: Work-stealing corrects any imbalance dynamically

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Scalability**: Linear scaling to 256 workers (tested)
2. **Cache Efficiency**:
   - 40-60% fewer cache misses vs global queue (benchmarked)
   - LIFO owner keeps hot data in L1/L2
   - CPU affinity prevents cache invalidation on migration
3. **Low Latency**:
   - Sub-microsecond task pickup when work available
   - 1μs initial backoff → responsive to bursts
4. **Load Balancing**:
   - Automatic via work stealing
   - No manual tuning or monitoring needed
5. **Coroutine-Friendly**:
   - WorkItem supports both functions and coroutine handles
   - Symmetric transfer integrates cleanly

### Negative

1. **Memory Overhead**:
   - N queues instead of 1 (N = number of workers)
   - ~100KB per worker (acceptable for 256 workers = 25MB)
2. **Stealing Overhead**:
   - Idle workers scan other queues (O(N) per steal attempt)
   - Mitigated by: adaptive backoff reduces scan frequency
3. **CPU Affinity Portability**:
   - Linux-only (pthread_setaffinity_np)
   - Degrades gracefully on other platforms (no-op)
4. **Complexity**:
   - More complex than simple thread pool
   - Justified by performance gains and scalability needs

### Migration Path

**Breaking Changes**:
- None (new component, no existing scheduler)

**Integration Steps**:
1. ✅ Implement WorkStealingQueue (lock-free, LIFO/FIFO)
2. ✅ Implement WorkStealingScheduler (per-worker queues)
3. ✅ Add adaptive backoff to worker loop
4. ✅ Add CPU affinity support (Phase D, optional)
5. ✅ Integrate with Task<T> coroutine system
6. ✅ Benchmark and tune backoff parameters

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Global Queue with Thread Pool

```cpp
class ThreadPool {
  std::queue<WorkItem> global_queue_;
  std::mutex queue_mutex_;
};
```

**Rejected**:
- **Contention**: All workers compete for single lock
- **Poor Scalability**: Lock contention increases with worker count
- **Cache Thrashing**: Random worker picks up task → no locality

**Benchmarks**: 10x slower than work-stealing at 64+ workers

### Alternative 2: Priority-Based Global Queue

**Rejected**:
- Still has global contention bottleneck
- Priority handled separately at agent inbox level (Phase C)
- Work-stealing orthogonal to message priority

### Alternative 3: Intel TBB task_arena

**Rejected**:
- Large external dependency (entire TBB library)
- Less control over scheduling behavior
- Integration complexity with custom coroutines
- Licensing considerations for deployment

### Alternative 4: Fixed Worker Assignment (Agent Affinity)

```cpp
// Assign each agent to specific worker permanently
worker_id = hash(agent_id) % num_workers;
```

**Rejected**:
- **No Load Balancing**: Some workers overloaded, others idle
- **Poor Locality**: Agent tasks scattered if hash collision
- **Inflexible**: Cannot adapt to dynamic load changes

**Hybrid Approach**: Use `submitTo()` for optional affinity, but allow stealing for balance.

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety

- **Lock-Free Queues**: moodycamel::ConcurrentQueue (MPMC, wait-free)
- **Atomic Counters**: Round-robin submission, shutdown flag
- **No Mutex**: Zero contention in hot path (submit/steal)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Submit**: O(1) lock-free enqueue
- **Pop (owner)**: O(1) lock-free LIFO dequeue
- **Steal (thief)**: O(1) lock-free FIFO dequeue
- **Idle Scan**: O(N) across all worker queues (mitigated by backoff)

### Resource Limits

```cpp
// FIX P2-10: DoS prevention
static constexpr size_t MAX_WORKER_THREADS = 256;

if (num_workers_ > Config::MAX_WORKER_THREADS) {
  throw std::invalid_argument("Too many worker threads");
}
```

**Rationale**: Prevents unbounded thread creation DoS attacks.

## Validation

### Unit Tests

- ✅ Submit and execute functions
- ✅ Submit and resume coroutines
- ✅ Work stealing between workers
- ✅ Graceful shutdown drains queues
- ✅ CPU affinity setting (Linux only)

### Benchmarks

- ✅ 1M tasks on 64 workers: 12ms (vs 120ms global queue)
- ✅ Linear scaling up to 128 workers
- ✅ Sub-microsecond task pickup latency

### E2E Tests

- ✅ Phase 3 E2E: Full 4-layer hierarchy (6 agents, 100+ coroutines)
- ✅ Concurrency stress test: 1000 concurrent messages
- ✅ No deadlocks, no data races (ThreadSanitizer clean)

## Future Evolution

### Phase 4: NUMA-Aware Scheduling

```cpp
// Allocate worker queue memory on local NUMA node
void* queue_mem = numa_alloc_onnode(sizeof(WorkStealingQueue), node_id);
```

### Phase 5: Work Stealing Heuristics

```cpp
// Steal from overloaded workers first, not round-robin
size_t victim = selectVictimByLoad(worker_loads);
```

### Distributed Work Stealing

```cpp
// Steal from remote nodes over network
WorkItem item = remote_scheduler->stealWork(remote_worker_id);
```
