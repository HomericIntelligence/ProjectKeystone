## Workflow Details

### Pre-commit Checks

```yaml
File: pre-commit.yml

# Run with TSan
docker build --build-arg CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=thread" .
```

## Workflow Triggers

### Pull Requests

All workflows run on:

- PR opened
- PR synchronized (new commits)
- PR reopened

### Push Events

All workflows run on pushes to `main` branch

### Scheduled

- **security-scan.yml**: Weekly on Mondays at 9 AM UTC

### Manual

## Artifacts and Retention

| Artifact | Retention | Size | Description |
|----------|-----------|------|-------------|
| Unit test results | 7 days | ~1 MB | GTest XML test results |
| Coverage reports | 7 days | ~5 MB | HTML and XML coverage |
| Build manifests | 7 days | <1 MB | Build metadata |
| Integration reports | 30 days | ~2 MB | E2E test results |

| Sanitizer results | 30 days | ~5 MB | ASan/UBSan/TSan logs |

## PR Comment Integration

All workflows post automated comments to PRs with results:

- **Unit Tests**: Coverage summary and test status
- **Build Validation**: Build status for all targets
- **Integration Tests**: Phase-by-phase status table
- **Security Scanning**: Security findings summary
- **Sanitizers**: Sanitizer results with pass/fail status

Comments are updated (not duplicated) on subsequent runs.

## Skipping Workflows

To skip CI workflows on a commit:

```bash
git commit -m "docs: Update README [skip ci]"
```

Note: This skips ALL workflows. Use sparingly and only for documentation changes.

## Local Development

### Running Pre-commit Locally

```bash
# Install
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Run all hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run clang-format --all-files
```

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Build and run tests in Docker
docker-compose up test

# Or in development container
docker-compose up -d dev
docker-compose exec dev bash
cd build && ctest --output-on-failure
```

### Running Builds Locally

```bash
# Build specific Docker target
docker build --target builder -t projectkeystone:builder .
docker build --target runtime -t projectkeystone:runtime .
docker build --target development -t projectkeystone:dev .

# Native build
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
ninja
```

### Running Security Scans Locally

```bash
# Gitleaks
docker run -v $(pwd):/path zricethezav/gitleaks:latest detect --source /path

# Semgrep
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src returntocorp/semgrep semgrep --config=auto /src

# Cppcheck
cppcheck --enable=all --suppress=missingIncludeSystem -I include src/
```

### Running Sanitizers Locally

```bash
# ASan + UBSan
docker build \
  --build-arg CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g" \
  -t projectkeystone:asan .
docker run --rm projectkeystone:asan

# TSan
docker build \
  --build-arg CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=thread -g" \
  -t projectkeystone:tsan .
docker run --rm projectkeystone:tsan

# Native build with sanitizers
mkdir -p build-asan && cd build-asan
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-omit-frame-pointer" ..
make
./phase1_e2e_tests
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Triggering

- Check branch protection rules
- Verify workflow file syntax
- Check GitHub Actions tab for errors
- Ensure repository has Actions enabled

### Docker Build Timeouts

- Increase `timeout-minutes` in workflow
- Use BuildKit caching
- Split large builds into stages

### Coverage Not Generating

- Ensure tests are built with coverage flags
- Check gcovr is installed in Docker image
- Verify test executables run successfully

### Security Scans False Positives

- Add suppressions to `.semgrepignore` or `.gitleaksignore`
- Use inline comments for cppcheck: `// cppcheck-suppress`
- Document false positives in PR comments

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks

- Review Dependabot PRs for GitHub Actions updates
- Check Security tab for new advisories
- Review failed scheduled security scans

### Monthly Tasks

- Update action versions (use Dependabot)
- Review artifact retention policies
- Clean up old workflow runs (automatic after 90 days)

### Quarterly Tasks

- Review and update pre-commit hooks
- Update Docker base images
- Review and update security scan configurations
